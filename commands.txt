Unpack the compressed archive file, and then copy the oc binary to a directory of your choice. Ensure that this directory is in the PATH variable for your system. On macOS and Linux, copy the oc binary to /usr/local/bin:
[user@host c~]$ sudo p oc /usr/local/bin/

[user@host ~]$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oc

Important
Windows users must adapt line-breaking characters in multi-line commands.

In PowerShell, use the backtick character (
>> -p RHT_OCP4_DEV_PASSWORD RHT_OCP4_MASTER_API
Note that PowerShell prints the >> prompt as a line-continuation marker.

This course does not provide support for alternative Windows shells, such as the Windows cmd command interpreter.
